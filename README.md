# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
•From the data, we can see that there are certain products are sold together.
•The company can use this data to leverage their sales and see which product should make promotions on for better margins

### Duration:
Approximately 5 hour 
### Project Description:
This is unsupervised-learning project where I used "Wholesale Data" dataset
During the EDA process, these are the finding:
•It looks as if all columns has a positive correlation with each other.
•However, the relationship between Detergents, Milk and grocery are higher correlation then other columns.
•Customers intend to purchase these products more frequently than others.

In this project, I completed the following tasks:
1- EDA and Data Cleaning
2- Used the following unsupervised learning models:
##### Kmeans
##### Hierarchical Clustering
##### PCA
